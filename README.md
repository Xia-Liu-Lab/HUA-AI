# HUA-AI
The clinical data and the code used for metagenome and metabolome data analysis in the article, entitled “Alistipes indistinctus-derived hippuric acid alleviates hyperuricemia via ABCG2-meidated intestinal urate excretion”.
This article does not produce new analysis software or code, all analysis is based on existing R packages and code.
